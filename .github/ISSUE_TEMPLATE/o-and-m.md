As part of day-to-day operation of Data.gov, there are many [Operation and Maintenance (O&M) responsibilities](https://github.com/gsa/data.gov/wiki/Operation-and-Maintenance-Responsibilities). Instead of having the entire team watching notifications and risking some notifications slipping through the cracks, we have created an [O&M Triage role](https://github.com/gsa/data.gov/wiki/Operation-and-Maintenance-Responsibilities#om-triage-rotation). One person on the team is assigned the Triage role which rotates each sprint. _This is not meant to be a 24/7 responsibility, only East Coast business hours. If you are unavailable, please note when you will be unavailable in Slack and ask for someone to take on the role for that time._

Check the [O&M Rotation Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cF73HkzFuQth3z9voLfVO1Cc4kjBd6ecHGE2gkj5LCc/edit?usp=sharing) for future planning.

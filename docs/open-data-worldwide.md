# Open Data efforts worldwide

[Data.gov](https://data.gov) is the U.S. government's home for open data, but
many other countries have similar efforts. This document is a very low-key
effort to collect links to these efforts for the purposes of sharing
information and experiences to improve the effectiveness of everyone's work in
these areas.

## U.S. - Data.gov

- [Data.gov](https://data.gov) says that it is "The Home of the U.S.
  Government's Open Data". The top-level site has general information and
  links to the data catalog and other resource sites.

- [catalog.data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov) is the public-facing metadata
  catalog. It contains information about more than 300,000 individual datasets
  from hundreds of organizations at national, state, and local levels. It runs on
  [CKAN](https://ckan.org/).


- [resources.data.gov](https://resources.data.gov) is an informational site
  with "policies, tools, case studies, and other resources to support data
  governance, management, exchange, and use throughout the federal
  government". Of primary importance to driving the metadata catalog is the
  [schema](https://resources.data.gov/resources/dcat-us/) for the DCAT-US 1.1
  metadata format used by many of the organizations providing metadata to
  Data.gov.

## U.K. - Data.gov.uk

- [Data.gov.uk](https://www.data.gov.uk) is the public-facing metadata catalog
  with over 50,000 datasets in the catalog. The [Government Digital Service
  (GDS)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service)
  [maintains the catalog](https://www.data.gov.uk/support). It runs on
  [CKAN](https://ckan.org/).

- [Guidance.data.gov.uk](https://guidance.data.gov.uk/) provides documentation
  for data publishers and documentation for the data.gov.uk API.

- The U.K. National Health Service maintains its own [open data
  site](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/access-our-data-products/open-data-portal-odp)
  including a [CKAN](https://ckan.org) metadata catalog at
  <https://opendata.nhsbsa.net/>
